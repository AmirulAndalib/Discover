# Using Discover Overlay

After installing with [Flathub](install_flathub), [Python PIP](install_pip) or from [another source](https://github.com/trigg/Discover) you should have a launcher icon in 'Utilities' for `Discover Overlay`.

While development is focused on X11 and wlroots-based environments, user testing has shown Plasma + Wayland as currently functional with a non-Flatpak install of Discover Overlay. (GNOME users will need X11.)

## Configuration

Once running, you should see the Discover Overlay logo in your system tray. On desktop environments without a system tray you can instead type `discover-overlay --configure` into the terminal or make a shortcut icon to open it if you wish.

## Nothing shows up?

Make sure you're running Discord, and enter a voice chat room. The list of users in the voice chat room should be overlayed on your primary display.
