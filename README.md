# Discover
Yet another discord overlay for linux written in Python using GTK3

Considerably lighter on system resources and less hack-and-slash included than discord-overlay.

## Installing

Requires PyGTK3, websocket_client

```
python3 -m pip install websocket_client
```

## Usage

run `discover.py`

Comes with sane-enough defaults but has a system tray icon & settings window if needed.

## Still in work

Not all features are at the level I would like.

To do list:

- Bash install script
- Multimonitor
- Text channels
- Text notifications (different from above)
- Open to suggestions

## Why do you keep making Discord Overlays?

I feel like I shouldn't have to at all! Until we get an official one I might just create a new one every few months. Look forward to Rust/Vulkan version coming in a few months.

### Are you serious?

Generally, no.
